## 🌐 Current Challenges:

**Deploying the app has presented some hurdles:**

The YouTube Transcript API doesn’t work in production, causing the LLM feature to fail. While it works perfectly in local environments (as shown in my demo video), I'm exploring solutions like proxies but need guidance on reliable free proxies or alternative approaches.

🥲 Eager to share this app with you guys after successful deployment. 

**💬 Open to Ideas & Suggestions:**

I’m excited to enhance and expand FocusTube! Whether it's feature recommendations, deployment tips, or innovative ideas, I’d love to hear your thoughts.
